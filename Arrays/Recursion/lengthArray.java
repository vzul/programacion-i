/*
Comparison to while (n > 0) { n = n / 10; counter++; }
In the while loop:

Each division (n / 10) is analogous to your recursive "jump" to the next index (i+1).
The counter is incremented for each division â€” in recursion, this is handled by returning 1 + recursive_result.
For an array:

Instead of dividing, you jump to the next index until you're out of bounds.
